Playground Series - S5E2: Backpack Prediction Challenge

Welcome to the Playground Series - S5E2 Kaggle competition! This project aims to predict the amount of weight that will be carried in a backpack based on various features. Let's dive into the problem and how you can get started with the competition.

Problem Overview
-------------------------
The goal of this competition is to predict the weight of items that fit in a backpack based on certain input features. Your objective is to create a model that can accurately predict this weight for given data. The dataset includes several features that influence the weight prediction.

Problem Statement:
-------------------------
Given a set of items and their respective features, predict the weight of the items that can be carried in the backpack.

Data
-------------------------
The dataset is divided into two main parts:

1. Train Data (train.csv): The training dataset includes labeled data where you have the input features and corresponding target values (weights). You'll train your model using this data.
2. Test Data (test.csv): The test dataset includes only the input features, and your model's task is to predict the weights for this set.

Dataset Features:
-------------------------
- feature_1: [Description of feature]
- feature_2: [Description of feature]
- feature_3: [Description of feature]
- ... (Continue listing relevant features)

Target Variable:
-------------------------
- weight: The weight of items that will be carried in the backpack.
